### OTC:

This month's Dead Coders Society will take place on Tuesday 24th June, meeting at 1pm at Adlib on Ingram Street, Glasgow. Jakub Konka will be presenting "The Ubiquitous B-Tree" (Cormen 1979).

Dead Coders is a meetup for anyone who loves theoretical computer science. Our format is simple: meet up & order lunch then whilst awaiting our food, the speaker gives a quick presentation of their chosen topic (index cards/slides optional). When the food arrives, we eat and discuss :)

All ages and experience levels welcome!
