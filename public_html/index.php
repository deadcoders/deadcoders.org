  <h2>FAQs</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>Must the topics discussed originate from literally dead programmers?</dt>
    <dd>No, we're just future-proofing.</dd>

    <dt>Why a lunchtime meet? Seems a bit tame - didn't the Dead Poets meet in a cave?</dt>
    <dd>
      We wanted to make the meetings accessible to as wide an audience as possible; a lunchtime
      meetup is convenient for a) people with kids, b) anyone too young to go to a pub in the evening
      and c) commuters. <i>That said,</i> if you have a suitable cave handy I'm sure we could organise
      something.

    <dt>How can I suggest a topic?</dt>
